OldDays, NBXlite and SpawnHuman return old things that were removed.
NBXlite is fork of InsanityBringer's NoBiomesX.

SSPC is a fork of simo_415's Single Player Commands 3.2.2.
Everything in src/client/spc, bin/spc-* and bin-old/spc-* is licenced under GNU LGPLv3.

To set this up:
1. Download MCP.
2. Decompile client using MCP.
3. Clone this repository to **src-mods** directory.
4. Go to **src-mods** and launch **deploy.sh** script.
5. It is ready. You may now recompile client and start it.

To build a release, launch make.sh script **in the MCP directory**. Not from src-mods!
Resulting zips will be in **reobf/result2**.
